# The Neon Punk Giphy Search and game
 First and formost this is going to be a page set up and ddedicated to searching Neon Punk/CYber Punk style Giphs using a Giphy API
 the search will be adult rated as to not leave any possible image out.  Im also going to attach a little Tic Tac Toe game i was working on on the side to better understand how Java and Css as well as Html work together to produce a simple little android deployable game for my daughter to play with on my Phone.

## Technology
1. html
2. CSS
3. Async Java Script
4. JSON
5. FUN - yeah just plane old fun

## User Stories
1. As the user i dont not want to be restricted by an age barrier in my search!
2. As a user the site should stick to vibrant colors using pink and yellows even blues where possible this will ensure the Neon Punk Asthetic.
3. As a user the giphys search should be easily copy able to paste in any other website or software being used on the pc/phone/tablet.
